"""Peak-snapshot JIT residency, split into three bands per class:

  currently_shared   bytes that are already bit-identical across procs.
                     If pages were mapped shared right now, these bytes
                     would collapse. In stock Firefox the actual mmap is
                     MAP_PRIVATE so this measures the hash-identity
                     ceiling, not achieved COW savings.

  achievable_shared  same source (IR / template / build-hash constant)
                     across procs but currently different compiled bytes
                     because the codegen embeds process-specific
                     addresses. Under a position-independent AOT scheme
                     these would collapse too.

  unique             one representative per distinct source. Irreducible
                     residue: the class has this many distinct sources,
                     each of which must live in memory at least once.

Ion is excluded from the three-band model on purpose: we don't emit
hash instrumentation for it. Its live bytes are still reported as a
class total (for JIT-memory accounting text) but there is no per-band
split.

Uniform decomposition. Every class runs through `three_band(instances)`
with no per-class special-casing beyond the ownership tag. Any peak
snapshot with live bytes in a class the analyzer has no rule for
crashes loudly rather than dropping silently.

Output: {"peak_checkpoint": ..., "n_procs": ...,
         "artifacts": [{name, total, currently_shared,
                        achievable_shared, unique}, ...],
         "ion_total": <bytes>}
